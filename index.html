            <h1>The Journey to Answer the Kindergarten Question</h1>
            <p>There's one question we all get asked as young children: What do you want to be when you grow up?
                I didn't realize that it would take so long to answer.  Here is the journey so far.

                    <h2>The College Years</h2>
                    <p>When I started college, my father told me I should major in Computer Science. 
                        But I had already decided to be a teacher. I double majored in Music Education and Mathematics.
                        After completing my student teaching, it became clear to me that teaching was not for me.
                        There was many reasons why, but having gone through all that work I knew that students
                        deserved a better teacher than I could be.  I guess I should have known that father knows best.</p>

                    <h2>The Dark Days</h2>
                    <p>Soon after graduation, I got married and moved to Kansas so that my husband could get his PHd
                        at KU.  Having decided not to be a teacher I needed a new job to fill my time. I applied a few
                        places and finally got a job at the PictureMe Portrait Studio in Walmart.  It was the worst job
                        I've ever had. No exaggerations.  If I wasn't attempting to take marginally good pictures of crying
                        children, I had to cold call people about having more pictures of their crying children taken.
                        The company focused more on upselling over priced prints than providing a quality product. It 
                        was a stressful time, but it motivated me to do something different.

                    <h2>The Cliche</h2>
                    <p>After the portrait studio I worked a short stint at a local balloon shop. But the hours weren't 
                        very consistent.  I needed a different job while I figured out what to do next.  I landed a 
                        position at the Starbucks in downtown Lawrence.  It was a bit tough resigning myself to being the
                        cliche of a college graduate working at Starbucks, but it wasn't a bad job.  I got promoted to
                        supervisor a few months after I started.  I enjoyed my co-workers and the friendships I made with
                        regular customers.  But working in retail, especially in a place where customer demands are so high,
                        begins to wear on you after a while. The hours were also inconsistent.  After a couple years it was
                        clear to me that this was not a career I would be happy in long term.</p>

                    <h2>A Change of Pace</h2>
                    <p>After a lot of deliberation I decided to take my dad's advice and look into computer science.
                        I've always been a fan of technology and math and coding logic are very closely related. I
                        signed up for some classes at JCCC.  I took to the coding classes quite easily.  I finally 
                        felt like I had found something I could enjoy doing for a living.  The only problem was the
                        classes were moving slowly and it was expensive.  After some talks with friends of mine in the
                        industry, I decided that learning on my own might move me faster towards my goal.  I got a new
                        job working at the KMart Distribution Center so that I could have more time to dedicate to learning.
